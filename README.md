# Machine-Learning-first-project
********************************************************************************************


The program takes data from " https://adak.shop/ " regarding to laptop specs and their price and save them into DataBase and with Machine Learning guess what the price of a customized Laptop is.

# ⚠️Important Note
⚠️ This project is currently non-functional due to a major redesign of the source website (adak.shop).

The website has been updated and now relies heavily on JavaScript to dynamically load content. Because of this, the laptop data (name, image, specs, and price) is no longer directly accessible using standard Python web scraping libraries like requests and BeautifulSoup.
********************************************************************************************
Required libraries:

scikit-learn

bs4

requests

mysql.connector (if you work with MySql Database)

sklearn

re (Web scraping matters)

********************************************************************************************
Warning: Make sure to rewrite the information about Database and connect to it successfully.
